<div class="text_box about">
	<p>Hello, my name is DanTech. I am currently in 11th grade. I really enjoy math (currently in calculus) and science (currently in Engineering and Physics) at my high school. I actively take part in my high school's engineering club and participated in <a href="http://www.squareonenetwork.org/innovative-vehicle-design/" target="_blank">Square One's Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge</a>. During the summer of 2013, I took an HTML and CSS intensive class through the <a href="https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Northwestern CTD</a>. I have also taken an introduction to Java class through CTD and hope to further my programming knowledge and engineering skills throughout my life. I also enjoy playing soccer for my high school and doing Tae Kwon Do.</p>
