	<p>I was born in Germany on July 19<sup>th</sup>, 1998. I lived there until I was almost six years old, which is when my family and I moved to the U.S. I am currently entering 10th grade at Glenbrook South High school. Over the summer I am taking a HTML and CSS intensive class through the Northwestern CTD. I have also taken an introduction the Java class through CTD and hope to further my programming knowledge throughout my life. I also enjoy playing soccer for my high school and doing Tae Kwon Do.</p>
