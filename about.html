<div class="text_box about">
	<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Weber. I am currently in 10th grade at Glenbrook South High School. I really enjoy math (currently in pre-calculus) and science (currently in chem-phys) at my high school. I actively take part in my high school's engineering club and I am currently part of a team of students creating an autonomous car to compete in an autonomous vehicle challenge. During the summer of 2013, I took an HTML and CSS intensive class through the <a href="https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu">Northwestern CTD</a>. I have also taken an introduction to Java class through CTD and hope to further my programming knowledge and engineering skills throughout my life. I also enjoy playing soccer for my high school and doing Tae Kwon Do.</p>
