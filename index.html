                <h2 class="about_header">About</h2>
                <p class="about_content">I am currently a senior in high school and enjoy creating and building a wide range of projects. I focus most heavily on electronics projects and programming projects. My favorite hobby is programming, where I have learned many different languages and have found many applications for my knowledge. I consistently take programming related summer courses, mostly through Northwestern's <a href="http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" class="inline_a_tag">CTD</a> and have learned how to make web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to create database backed applications using the Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
                <p class="about_content">I have also achieved significant proficiency in the Java programming language over many years of practice and application and have also gained a good amount of knowledge about Arduino programming and electronics. I also recently got a Raspberry Pi and have been experimenting with it's GPIO capabilities. I have also recently taken a course through Coursera called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" class="inline_a_tag">Machine Learning</a>, which greatly interested me and has influenced me to study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence more in the future. This interest in Machine Learning influenced me to take another online course title <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/synapses" target="_blank" class="inline_a_tag">Synapses, Neurons, and the Brain</a>. Apart from programming, I also have played soccer for over a decade for various teams and have been doing Taekwondo for several years now.</p>

                    <p class="project_content">This is my JavaScript version of an IOS and Android game called aa. After watching friends play this game on their iPhones, I really wanted to play it. However, I found out that the app didn't exist for Android phones at the time, so I decided to recreate the game so that I could play it. Initially I coded a JavaScript version of the game before porting the code to android. I even released the app on the Google Play App Store, but unfortunately, the creators of the iPhone version asked me to take it down.</p>

In both years we enjoyed great successes, winning 3 first place trophies the first year for performance, design, and engineering and 2 first place trophies the seconds year in performance and ambassadorship.
