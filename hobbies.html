	<p>I like to program on Arduino in my free time or experiment with my Numark Mixtrack Pro DJ set. I have also recently taken an interest in making remixes of songs using Audacity. I posted my first remix to SoundCloud which you can listen to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/doga1216/radioactive-spectrum-remix" target="_blank">here</a>. I also like to make JavaScript games and websites for them. I recently participated in the 2013-2014 Google Code In and completed a whopping four tasks, winning me an official Google Code In t-shirt and a certificate of completion.</p>
	<p>I like biking with my friends or jogging around my neighborhood. I also like going to the movies with my friends. I also like playing video games. I currently have an X-Box 360<sup>TM</sup> and I love to play Fifa<sup>TM</sup>13 on it and I must say, I am pretty good at it.</p>
