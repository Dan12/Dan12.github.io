	<p>I like to program on Java in my free time or model on Maya. I also like biking with my friends and buying lots of junk food. I also like going to the movies with my friends. Here is my summer movie list:</p>
	<p>World War Z, Now You See Me, Monsters University, <s>Lone Ranger</s>, Despicable Me 2, Pacific Rim, Wolverine, Elysium, Catching Fire, The Desolation of Smaug, Star Trek Into Darkness, Thor into Darkness, and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2.</p>
	<p>As you can see, my list is very long and at $10.25 per movie, there is great doubt as to whether my allowance will last that long. Some of my other activities that I take part in with my friends is playing video games. I currently have an X-Box 360<sup>TM</sup> and I love to play Fifa<sup>TM</sup> on it.</p>
