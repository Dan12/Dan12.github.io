	<p>I like to program on Java in my free time or model on Maya. I have also recently taken an interest in making remixes of songs using Audacity. I posted my first remix to SoundCloud which you can listen to <a href=”https://soundcloud.com/doga1216/radioactive-spectrum-remix”>here</a>. I also like to make JavaScript games and websites for them. I recently participated in the 2013-2014 Google Code In and completed a whopping four tasks, winning me an official Google Code In t-shirt and a certificate of completion.</p>
	<p>I also like biking with my friends and buying lots of junk food. I also like going to the movies with my friends. Some of my other activities that I take part in with my friends are playing video games. I currently have an X-Box 360<sup>TM</sup> and I love to play Fifa<sup>TM</sup> on it and I must say, I am pretty good.</p>
