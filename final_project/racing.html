				<p class="review_content">In Zombie Road Trip the rules are simple - escape the zombie horde or have your brain eaten. Are you up for the challenge? Race against the unrelenting Zombie Horde across the great wastelands in the never-ending game of survival.</p>
				<p class="review_content">This game is very action packed and gets you hooked from the start. The endless missions and terrain combine for never ending fun and a never boring game. It does take some time to work up to the amount of coins and upgrades to start having some fun, but once you get there, it is all out fun. They have a nice background music feature with musical content for everyone. Once you have some coins and actually have a car and gun that will take you far, you can concentrate on landing your frontflips and backflips perfectly every time. The game automaticly judges the quality of your landing and charges your boost based on your landing. This is a fun and addictive part of the game. Overall, a constantly addictive zombie apacalyps survival game. <b>Rating: 4.5/5</b></p>
