				<p class="review_content">This new and popular game has stayed ot the top for quite some time now. The secrect to its imense success is rooted in its ability keep gamers coming back and playing every day with daily challenges and weekly iteam hunts. If that isn't enough to keep someone hooked, the fact that they change the scenery and objectives every month keeps you checking back to see where Subway Surfers is next and what cool new things have been added. There is the ocasional glitch and some slow starts on some devices. There has recently been a large post game image glitch on some devices that has not yet been fixed after 2 weeks. But other than that, the game is the perfect smartphone game and has had great success. <b>Rating: 4.9/5</b></p>
