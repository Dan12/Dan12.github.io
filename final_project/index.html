				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Description:</p>
				<p class="review_content"><i>In Zombie Road Trip the rules are simple: escape the zombie horde or have your brain eaten. Are you up for the challenge? Race against the unrelenting Zombie Horde across the great wastelands in the never-ending game of survival.</i></p>
				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Review:</p>
				<p class="review_content">This game is very action packed and gets you hooked from the start. The endless missions and terrain combine for never ending fun and a never boring game. It does take some time to work up to the amount of coins and upgrades to start having some fun, but once you get there, it is all out fun. They have a nice background music feature with musical content for everyone. Once you have some coins and actually have a car and gun that will take you far, you can concentrate on landing your front flips and backflips perfectly every time. The game automatically judges the quality of your landing and charges your boost based on your landing. This is a fun and addictive part of the game. Overall: a constantly addictive zombie apocalypse survival game. <b>Rating: 4.5/5</b></p>

			<h4 class="app_name">Fruit Ninja</h4>
			<div class="icon_content">
				<div class="review_app_icon"></div>
				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Description:</p>
				<p class="review_content"><i>Fruit Ninja is a juicy action game with squishy, splatty and satisfying fruit carnage! Become the ultimate bringer of sweet, tasty destruction with every single slash! Fruit Ninja is the original and the best slasher on Android. The addictive gameplay will keep you coming back for even higher scores!</i></p>
				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Review:</p>
				<p class="review_content">This classic game fully utilizes the touch features of today’s smartphones and allows for endless fun and slashing. You can sit there for hours and slash away at fruit and breath sighs of relief when you miss a bomb. You can compete with your friends and see who can get the highest score. It does become a little repetitive after a short time playing it. The three different modes add a little variety and the new store lets you get better scores, but it does become boring. However, it is very well made and totally draws the user in. Also, another drawback is that some achievements are slightly unrealistic and the free version does come at the cost of having a less variable gaming environment. Overall, it is a fun and enjoyable game for beginners, and is nice to play when you have some free time. <b>Rating: 4.0/5</b></p>

				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Review:</p>
				<p class="review_content">This new and popular game has stayed on the top for quite some time now. The secret to its immense success is rooted in its ability keep gamers coming back and playing every day with daily challenges and weekly item hunts. If that isn't enough to keep someone hooked, the fact that they change the scenery and objectives every month keeps you checking back to see where Subway Surfers is next and what cool new things have been added. There is the occasional glitch and some slow starts on some devices. There has recently been a large post game image glitch on some devices that has not yet been fixed after 2 weeks. But other than that, the game is the perfect smartphone game and has had great success. <b>Rating: 4.9/5</b></p>

				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Description:</p>
				<p class="review_content"><i>Can you infect the world?

Plague Inc. evolves the strategy genre and pushes mobile gaming (and you) to new levels. It’s You vs. the world; only the strongest can survive!</i></p>
				<p class="review_content review_content_header">Review:</p>
				<p class="review_content">This game is a great puzzle game and will really push your thinking and responsive skills to the limit. Even though this is the point of the game and it would be boring if it was easier, it has a hard time integrating itself in this modern world of smartphone gaming. It is a fun game with tons of different ways to play and interact with the game, but there is also a line where difficulty becomes to great for many and people are either forced to buy the full game to make it a little easier or they quite the game altogether. On the up side, it has a continuously changing and adapting game environment and several different plague types and difficulties to chose from. All in all, a fun but sometimes frustrating game. <b>Rating: 3.8/5</b></p>
